# sender's Hackbook

This is my personal repo of portable and useful pentesting tools. It includes scripts, aliases, and command compendiums I've written, along with lots of common and publicly available tools that I didn't, collected conveniently into folders for recall with my scripts. The contents of this repo saved me untold hours and repetitive commands, and helped me pass the OSCP on my first attempt.

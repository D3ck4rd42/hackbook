# Privilege Escalation

This is a collection of all of my most commonly transferred files to a machine after getting an initial shell. 

> I include an ssh public key here as it's something I use a lot for persistence, however obviously you'll need to generate your own keys. 

## Usage

Obviously these folders are useful in and of themselves, however to install these in the correct directory to be used with my scripts, see the [scripts](/scripts/) README.
